# App Logic

## - start() -

* Once the app loads, the 'start' function will run, and the customer will be given the following choices via 'inquirer':

    1. Departments ('Electronics', 'Hardware', 'Games/Toys', & 'Sporting Goods)
    2. View Cart
    3. Exit

    ### - deptMenu() - 

    1. If the customer chooses a department, the 'deptMenu' function will run. The app will then connect to the MySQL database, access the 'products' table, and the chosen department will be passed into the query. 

        * Looping through the query results, the customer will be shown a list of items for sale in the chosen department along with a 'return' option

            #### - addItemPrompt() -

            1. If the user chooses an item, the 'addItemPrompt' funtion will run

            * The chosen product, price, and stock are assigned to variables and the user is asked if they want to added the item to their cart via 'inquirer'

                ##### Yes

                1. If the user chooses 'Yes', the following functions will run if the stock of the chosen item in the product table is greater than 0:

                    ##### - addtoSQLCart -

                    * addToSQLCart - The app will connect to the MySQL database, access the 'cart' table, and add the chosen item information and a quantity of 1 to the cart table

                    ##### - removeSQLstock -

                    * removeSQLstock - The app will connect to the MySQL database, access the 'products' table, and remove one (1) unit of stock from the chosen item in the product table

                    ##### - updateNodeCart -

                    * updateNodeCart - The app will connect to the MySQL database and access the 'cart' table.

                        * The length of the results object is stored to a variable, and logged as the total numbe of items in the cart

                        * The cost of the item added to the cart is pushed to an array, and all of the costs in the array are added together to give the cart total cost

                    ##### - deptMenu -

                    * deptMenu - the customer is returned to the list of items in the chosen department

                #### No

                2. If the user chooses 'No', the 'deptMenu' function will run and the customer is returned to the list of items in the chosen department

            ### - Return Option -

            2. If the user chooses 'Return' the 'start' function will run and the customer will be returned to the main menu

    ###  - viewNodeCart() -

    2. If the customer chooses 'View Cart', the 'viewNodeCart' function will run. The app will then connect to the MySQL database and access the 'cart' table

        #### Empty Cart

        * If the length of the results is 0, the message 'Cart Empty' will be logged, and the 'start' function will run returning the customer to the main menu

        #### If the cart has 1 or more items

        * The current cart information (total number of items + total cost) will be logged, along with a breakdown of the items in the cart by looping through the query results

        * The customer will then be given the following choics via 'inquirer':

            1. Checkout

                #####  - checkoutMenu() - 

                * If the customer chooses checkout the 'checkoutMenu' function will run, and the app will then connect to the MySQL database and access the 'cart' table.

                * The results are logged displaying the cart information and the customer is given the following choics via 'inquirer'

                    1. Complete Order

                        * If the customer chooses 'complete order', the customer is thanked, the SQL database is reset, and the connection is closed

                    2. Return

                        * If the customer chooses 'return', the 'start' function will run and the customer is returned to the main menu

                * Looping through the results the customer will be shown their current cart breakdown, and asked which item they would like to remove via 'inquirer' along with a 'return' option.

                    1. If the customer chooses to remove an item:

                    ##### - removeItemPrompt() -

                    * The 'removeItemPrompt' function will run. The information for the product chosen is assigned to variables, and the customer is asked if they want to remove the item via 'inquirer'

                        1. If the customer chooses 'yes' the following functions will run:

                            * Note: The following functions are the inverse to the functions that are run when the 'addItemPrompt' function runs

                            ##### - removeFromSQLCart() -
                            ##### - addSQLstock()

                            * After the above functions run the following functions will run:

                            ##### - updateNodeCart()

## Technologies used within the App

* mysql node module
* inquirer node module

## Notes

* I am responsbile for creating all logic and writing all code within all files of this app

## Issues

[Issues](demo-vids/issues.mp4)

* I was not able to write the code asking the customer how many units of the chosen item they would like to add to their cart. 
* I was also not able to update the SQL cart so that only the quantitiy for the chosen item updates when the item is added. When a customer adds the same item it will add all of the information to the SQL cart table. I plan to refine this code in the future.
* When the user chooses to remove an item, if the selected item has more that one (1) entry in the SQL cart, all of the items matching that product name will be removed.
